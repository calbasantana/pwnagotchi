# Introduction
I have been traveling a lot recently and have been reminiscing about the Tamagotchi era of my youth after reading up on Pwnagotchi, I decided it was time to make one for myself and see what the fuzz was about.
# 3D-Printed Case
There are a lot of readily available STLs to make your own Pwnagotchi case. I eventually settled on Yet Another Pwnagotchi Case by rmrfus on Thingiverse, which can be found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6446341/files

I decided to print the sleeker version, without the mount.

The total cost of the project is approximately ~$93. excluding taxes, cost of 3D printed parts, and a couple of 2mm hex screws I had lying around to screw in the bottom of the case.
# Initial Assembly
This part is pretty straightforward. First, use the four provided screws to screw the Zero 2W atop the battery. Then, place the Waveshare HAT atop the Zero 2W. We still need to add the software piece to it, so set aside the two screws and 3D-printed case.
# Software Installation
Place the microSD card inside a microSD card reader and connect it to your computer.

For this next part, I relied on tutorials that were readily available. One that was really easy to access was the following: https://github.com/Arnxb007/Pwnagotchi-on-waveshare-v4?tab=readme-ov-file

1. I first downloaded the .zip pwnagotchi file from: https://github.com/DrSchottky/pwnagotchi/releases/ and the config.toml file from: https://github.com/Arnxb007/Pwnagotchi-on-waveshare-v4?tab=readme-ov-file
2. I then used Raspberry Pi Imager on my Zorin OS Linux computer and flashed the microSD card with the downloaded .img file (make sure to extract it from the zipfile first!).
![Image_3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cac9cfdf-b572-43e6-a3b5-02df9cf7a7ef)
3. Edit the config.toml file as needed (for name of the Pwnagotchi and whitelist networks), then upload it to the boot partition of the microSD card.
4. Insert the microSD card into the initial assembly block, then connect the Zero 2W using the data port to your PC (microUSB closest to miniHDMI port). After a few minutes, you should see something like this:

5. If you go to network settings on your computer (I am using Zorin OS), you should see USB Ethernet after connecting your Pwnagotchi. Here, edit the IPv4 settings to include the IP address as: 10.0.0.1 and the Netmask as: 255.255.255.0. It should look like this:
![Image_5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e50d50e-4f66-421b-b9bf-c010f12e64e3)

7. In your browser, put the following address: http://10.0.0.2:9000/ and now you should be greeted with this:

9. The default user is admin and the default password is admin. The next screen should be the GUI for the Pwnagotchi.

10. From here, you can make any edits you want. I highly recommend putting it in auto mode. It will, over the next few minutes running, run it in AI mode, which optimizes for efficiency in pwning.

# Final Assembly
Now, disconnect the initial assembly block from your PC and press the button above the magnet behind the battery to boot up the battery. Insert the battery into the 3D printed case and screw in the cover. You should have a fully, ready-to-pwn, Pwnagotchi!
